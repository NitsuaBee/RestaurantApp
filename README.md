This project is a custom-built website created for a family member to enhance the online presence of their restaurant.

*I'm sure there are quite a few errors in the code especially clunky-ness and also unncessary code that shouldn't be there/isn't being used. I completed this project under a bit of pressure, with just two days to build both the website and my portfolio. My goal was to showcase my front-end development skills on my resume and also help a family member by providing them with a much-needed website.
